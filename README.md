        Origins of My Journey: A Passion for Coding Introduction:
Like many people who are invested in the technology field, my introduction to it began with a flash game. 

Playing flash games turned into curiosity about how these games are made, and then my curiosity turned into interest, which turned into investment. 

And then, investment turns into a **passion**.

Since then, my interest in technology has evolved from wanting to make flash games to creating usable projects that can change the world.
